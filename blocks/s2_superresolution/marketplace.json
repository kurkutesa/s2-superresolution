  "overview": "This Superresolution block takes a Sentinel-2 image and applies deep learning techniques to improve the resolution of the multi-spectral bands. A Sentinel-2 image has 13 spectral bands which are obtained at three different spatial resolutions (10m, 20m, and 60m). In order to achieve the higher spatial resolution for all the spectral bands within 20m and 60m, the super-resolution algorithm utilizes a convolutional neural networks (CNN) to perform the upsampling. Training of these networks are based on lower spatial resolutions which are obtained by downsampling the 20m and 60m. As mentioned by the author, these networks are trained based on images from different climate zones and land-cover types to achieve a good generalization. Therefore, this block employs the pre-trained networks and returns super-resolved images with the Geotiff format.
